- My bio: My name is Slavian Colodi. Am originally from Moldova and currently live in Berlin. 
- A "placinte" recipe: This Moldovan Cheese Pie is a savory reminder of his childhood. My mother in law Natasha told me how to make the filling and I watched youtube videos in Russian to learn how to make it. I don’t understand Russian so there was some guess work involved but the final result was perfect. If you love cheese and dill you will love this pie. I try not to make it too often because it’s hard to stop myself from eating the whole thing.
